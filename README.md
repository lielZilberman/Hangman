# Hangman
my JavaScript-HTML-CSS hangman game


# Game rules
Hangman is a simple word guessing game.
Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters.
If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

# How to play
1. Choose a topic - at the main menu, there are 3 topics: Animals, Countries and Food just choose one of them.
2. A random word related to the chosen topic has been created
3. Start guessing - every correctly guessed letter will appear on the screen, however, every wrong guess will advance the player towards hanging.
4. After 10 wrong guesses, the player will be hanged and the game will be over - the correct word will appear on the screen
5. Play again! - whether you lost or won you can just press the "play again" button and choose a new topic or a new word!




Have fun!
